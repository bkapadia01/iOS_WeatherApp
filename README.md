Weather App - TB Project 2
This is an iOS weather app built using the Open Weather API. The app displays the current forecast, hourly forecast and daily forecast.

Current Location: The app uses the current latitude and longitude of the device and identifies the city the device is in. The search icon presents a city picker that is pre-populated with several popular locations and provides the forecast for these locations. The background image is updated based on the city selected.
